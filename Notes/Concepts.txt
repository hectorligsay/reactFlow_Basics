To build web flows:
Output
> Shape Color
> Shape Type
> Zoom Level

Grey Circles are called handles  to connect to different nodes  
* lines are edges that connect each nodes
* circles are dots `

To create notes:
const nodes: Node[] = [
  {
    id: "1",
    data: {
      label: "Node 1",
    },
    position: { x: 0, y: 0 },
  },
  {
    id: "2",
    data: {
      label: "Node 2",
    },
    position: { x: 200, y: 200 },
  },
];

To create edges:
// Build edges
const edges: Edge[] = [{ id: "1-2", source: "1", target: "2", animated: true }];

To implement it onto the page:
export const Workflow = () => {
  return (
    <Box height={"500px"} width="500px" border="1px solid black">
      <ReactFlow nodes={nodes} edges={edges} fitView>
        <Controls />
        <Background />
      </ReactFlow>
    </Box>
  );
};

1. We use the ReactFlow component and put nodes/edges in there. fitView 
is used to auto scale to view the nodes.
2. Controls allows user to move around and zoom in/out. 
3. Background adds dots to make it look kewl
